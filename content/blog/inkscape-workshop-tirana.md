<p>Quite some time has passed since we first got in touch with the <a href="http://opensourcedesign.net/" target="_blank">Open Source Design community</a>. While being an utopian idea in the beginning, it has become clear to us that bringing Open Source values to Design and vice versa requires more of a culture shift than anything else. Having this mantra in mind, we tried to apply these principles in all communities we were part of. While Ura has a global audience, we care about our roots as well, which are in Tirana, Albania. We were happy to bring young designers in town more information about Open Source Design and the efforts the community is putting into improving Free Software/ Open Source projects.</p>

<p>Consequently, we organized another <a href="https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/tirana-albania/573/1" target="_blank">Design workshop</a> at the local <a href="https://openlabs.cc/en/" target="_blank">Open Labs Hackerspace</a>, this time with a deep dive into Inkscape. While there have been a few designers who worked with Adobe tools, everyone was new to Inkscape, so we went all the way from explaining basic tools, to designing a poster and making it production ready. The attendees were free to pick a main topic for their poster and design it themselves. Towards the end things were becoming interesting as people debated on colors, typography and other design rules.</p>

<p>The workshop was great fun and we learnt new things as well! Who said that giving workshops does not teach you something too? We are looking forward to host another workshop soon.</p>
